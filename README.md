# spaceship-titanic

This repo will be used in a kata at two COM-DEV sessions, the first on 3 October 2023. The working problem is extracted from Kaggle website, where a description of the problem as well as the dataset is provided. We will work with the problem [Spaceship Titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spaceship-titanic/). Our task is to develop a Machine Learning (ML) model to predict which passengers are transported to an alternate dimension.

The work will be divided in two sessions:

- One session dedicated to setup a Python environment with all the dependencies required for working in a ML project. This session will introduce the use of Jupyter notebook and the libraries [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/index.html) and [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial/introduction.html) for the task of Data Analysis. In this session we will analyze and visualice the data and their relationships and try to prepare the data for being given later to a ML model.

- A second session dedicated to select, train and evalute ML models by employing the library [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/getting_started.html), with the objective of solving the Spaceship-Titanic problem.
